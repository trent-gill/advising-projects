# Academic Advising Projects, by Trent Gill

## About

Advisor: [Trent Gill](http://trentgill.ca/) at [Brandon University](http://brandonu.ca/)
Work Website: https://www.brandonu.ca/academic-advising/

This website compiles and showcases some of the advising tools, resources, and projects that I have been involved with in my capacity. Use the left menu   

## Advising Syllabus

The purpose of the academic advising syllabus is to inform students of the learning outcomes, expectations, and process of working with an academic advisor at Brandon University.

I created this resource so advisors can work from a shared understanding of advising in Student Services. It was created in consultation with Alex Braun and Laurie Schewchuk.

### What is Academic Advising?

Advising is grounded in the teaching and learning objectives of higher education. Academic advisors at Brandon University work with students to develop an educational plan and to make meaning of their learning experiences. It is the process through which students consciously assess their goals, interests, and abilities to create and refine a formal learning strategy. The purpose of advising is to guide and support students in crafting a fulfilling education that complements their self-assessment.

By engaging in the advising process, students should become more autonomous, empowered, informed, and successful in their intellectual and professional pursuits. Students will be equipped to make decisions and solve problems specific to their academic progress.

### Academic Advising Fundamentals

Advisors at Brandon University have a variety of professional backgrounds and may use different approaches for advising. However, we agree on the following principles of academic advising.

* Advising is a teaching and learning process that has its own curriculum, pedagogy, and learning outcomes.
* Advising plays an important role in students’ experience of university education.
* Advising is a collaborative process in which students’ active participation is essential.
* Advising supports decisions for students whose purposes for post-secondary studies vary according to their self-assessment. Some examples include intellectual curiosity, engaged citizenship, career preparation, professional flexibility, economic mobility, and personal growth.

### Learning Outcomes

Students have several reasons for consulting an academic advisor. In general, though, academic advisors expect that students will learn how to:

* assess their interests, strengths, and goals to inform program, course, and career selection
* seek out opportunities and experiences that confirm or invalidate their long-term goals
* create an educational plan based on strengths, goals, interests, and values
* use information from diverse sources to support the decision-making process
* make meaning of their education and describe the purpose of their learning experiences
* articulate transferable skills (intellectual and practical competencies) acquired through formal and informal learning, including: how to problem solve, how to research, how to explain and communicate, and how to think critically.

### Advisor Responsibilities

Advisors at Brandon University will:

* discuss program and course options available to students at Brandon University
* help students develop an educational plan that fits each individual’s goals, abilities, and values
* stay informed of regulations, policies, and procedures that affect how students progress through an academic program (degree requirements, appeal processes, course sequencing, academic standing, etc.)
* demonstrate how to use advising resources, including registration guides, academic calendar(s), and online registration system
* teach students how to check degree progress using the appropriate resource
* make referrals to others, when appropriate, throughout the advising process
* help students understand how GPA is calculated and how it affects academic standing
ensure that all communication regarding the student’s academic performance remains confidential.

### Student Responsibilities

As a student, you will:

* commit to being an active and engaged learner
* assume responsibility for your choices, studies, and program requirements
* assess your abilities, interests, values, and goals to understand how they intersect with educational pathways
* have an open mind about learning and implementing new strategies for academic success
* research volunteer, co-op, education, and employment opportunities that complement your studies and support your long-term goals
* have realistic expectations for your academic workload.

### Key Resources

Through academic advising, students should expect to gain a working knowledge of the following resources.

* Academic Calendar
* Registration Guide
* Completed Semester Slot Schedule
* Course Syllabi
* Important Dates/Deadlines (Add/Drop, Voluntary Withdrawal)
* Final Exam Schedule
* Degree Worksheets
* Academic Integrity Policy

### Statement on Indecision

“Research shows that students who enter college without a major, and take the time to explore their options, will graduate within the same time frame as students who enter with a major and then, on average, change majors twice” (Gordon).

### Meeting with Your Advisor

Students should meet with an academic advisor whenever they need help navigating the post-secondary system. You are required to see an academic advisor when you are registering for your first courses. Other times you might want to see an academic advisor include:

* when you are considering making a course change and you aren’t sure how it will affect your eligibility to graduate
* when you need help determining entrance requirements for other programs
* when you want to take a course elsewhere and you want to know which courses transfer and how they fit within your Brandon University degree
* when you need to check your degree progress or your timeframe for graduation.

Before an advising appointment, you should:

* take a look at the current registration guide and the academic calendar
* jot down courses you think you will need for your degree, and courses that you are interested in
* consider what other commitments might be involved in your academic day (work, family, etc.)
* be prepared to discuss course options, address academic problems or concerns, make decisions about the upcoming semester, and explore major/minor options
arrive on time for your advising appointment.

## First Year at a Glance

Your first year is an important transition period as a new university student. As advisors, we want you to set realistic goals, understand decision-making, and take responsibility for your choices. Your engagement in the advising process is crucial for your success. Use this guide to plan your first year at BU!

To ensure a successful transition to university, we encourage you to be both exploratory and goal-oriented in choosing courses.

! This guide is meant to be read in conjunction with the New Student Advising course on Moodle. The first-year advising manual is also available as an [e-book](http://trentgill.ca/bu-advising-course/).

### Choosing Courses

Choosing courses is different in university than high school. In high school, you probably had limited choice and less flexibility with what subjects you studied. Now, it’s up to you to decide what courses you want to take and how they fit together in your academic plan.

What is an academic plan? Once you set goals for your post-secondary education, whether it’s being qualified for a career or obtaining an advanced degree, an academic plan is an explicit strategy for fulfilling that vision.

In your first year, however, it’s important to not get too carried away with what your plan is five years from now.

After all, you may not yet have a detailed plan of what you want to major or minor in, or what specific career you want to pursue once you complete a degree. You may not even know what subject area or field interests you the most. You may change your mind several times before landing on the right path for you.

That’s okay! Your first year is an opportunity to explore what you’re interested in and become more familiar with how each subject is studied at the university level.

Before making a decision that will impact your future, it’s important to be informed. Having a clear purpose for pursuing a degree plays an important role in your success as a student and the likelihood that you’ll fulfill your goals.

### What You Need

1. [Academic Calendar](http://brandonu.ca/calendar)
2. [Registration Guide(s)](http://brandonu.ca/registration)
3. Limited Availability List
4. Slot Schedule

* Use the Academic Calendar to identify courses that are required for a potential major and minor. The Academic Calendar will also have descriptions for courses in each department.
* Use the current Registration Guide to see what courses are available in the upcoming semesters.
* Use the Limited Availability List to see if there is still space available in the courses that interest you.
* Use the Slot Schedule to ensure that you don’t have any conflicts between lecture times, lab times, and other obligations (work, family, extracurriculars, etc.).

### Tips for Planning Your First Year

* Take courses that interest you. Do your research by reading course descriptions and browsing department webpages on the Brandon University website.
* Take courses in subject areas that may lead to a major or minor. Each major and minor will have courses at the 100 level that are required.
* If your planned major has “ancillary courses” (or “corequisites”), consider taking one or more of them.
* Take upgrading courses that fulfill prerequisites for courses you want to take eventually.
* Take courses that fulfill a requirement for admission to another post-secondary program, if that is in your plan.
* Take elective courses in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences that also fulfill Brandon University’s Liberal Education Requirements.
* Take courses in subject areas that you enjoyed in high school and want to explore at a deeper level.

### Courseload and Labs

How many courses are you comfortable with taking in your first year? The maximum number of courses you can take per semester is 5 (15 credit hours). To be eligible for full-time status, the minimum number of courses is 3 (9 credit hours).

Given that information, we normally advise students to take between 3 and 5 courses. There are exceptions. For example, if you are returning to university after a long break from formal education, you may only want one or two. If you are receiving a scholarship, you may need totake 4 or 5 courses. Or, if you are taking courses on a part-time basis while working, one course
may be all you can handle.

Keep in mind that for each hour of class lecture, you will be expected to do an hour (or more) of work outside of class, including reading, studying, research, and assignments. 

### Schedule

We understand that students have obligations outside of school. You need to be realistic about when you can attend class. The number one way to ensure your success is to attend all classes, so we advise against registering for courses whose lecture times conflict with other obligations.

### Academic Preparation

If you are new to university, then you may be concerned about how prepared you are for coursework. 

Although most 100-level courses are meant to be accessible for new students (unless you lack a prerequisite from high school), you may also find yourself in a situation where you have to acquire new skills to succeed in your courses. You may have to attend workshops or seek help with study skills, writing, or research. This workload can add up, so make sure that you stay ahead in your courses by taking good notes in class, doing the readings, and regularly reviewing your materials.

### Academic Advising

If you’re in doubt about degree and course selection, it’s a good idea to see an academic advisor. Academic advisors work with students to understand program requirements and schedule courses according to individual needs. We advise; you decide!
